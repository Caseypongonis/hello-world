# hello-world
My first repository I'm learning to do along the GitHub Guider
I am moving up in the technology world, yet I still feel like I'm so behind or doing it wrong
I can't believe so many people understand and do this in the world for their job
I wonder if I'll be working so in depthly online like this at a job 
If so I hope it allows me the travel and stress free life I'm chasing after
